Okay. So.

git status
//To see if git even exists in the directory you're in
//This will also show you what hasn't been committed to the repo yet


git add -A
//This will add all files that have been modified but not pushed or saved to the repo yet.


git commit -m "my git commit message here"
//This is how you give git the package of files or whatever you just added and kinda wraps it in a bundle to push to git. 


git push origin master
//This is how you push to git. I have no idea if it works differently for collaborators vs the one who started the git.


git pull origin master
//This is how you pull from git. I'm not sure if we need to do this since cloud9 already saves the changes.


//The git config stuff
I think you just need to use your own github login, but this is how I configured git when I said "git init".
